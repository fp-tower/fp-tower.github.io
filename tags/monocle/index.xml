      <description>A frequently requested feature is the ability to report why an optic failed. It is particularly crucial when you build a sophisticated optic. Say you have a large configuration document, and you want to focus on kafka.topics.order-events.partitions. There may not be a partitions key, or if it exists, it may have an unexpected format, e.g. it is a String instead of an Int. In Monocle and other optics libraries, we currently cannot provide any details about the failure.</description>

      <description>We recently started the development of the next major version of Monocle, Monocle 3.x. In this post, I would like to explain our objectives and discuss some of the changes we intend to make.
Monocle 3.x will be a complete rewrite. It doesn&#39;t mean we will change everything, but we will question every aspect of the library: optics encoding, API, names, dependencies, etc. We defined the following objectives to help us make trade-offs in the new design:</description>

      <description>Monocle, like many other Scala functional libraries, was inspired by Haskell. In our case, it is the Lens library by Edward Kmett and al.
In Monocle, we experimented with various optics encoding: pair of functions, Van Laarhoven, and profunctor (see LensImpl). The JVM and Haskell runtime are hugely different, and an encoding that works well in Haskell can be inefficient in Scala. For example, Haskell relies on zero cost wrapper (newtype) to effectively select typeclass instances, but we don&#39;t have an equivalent in Scala/JVM yet (opaque types may help).</description>
