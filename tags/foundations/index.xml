      <description>After nearly two years of hard work, I am excited to announce Foundations of Functional Programming in Scala, is now available on Early Access!
Foundation is a self-paced online course that focuses on the practical side of functional programming. You will learn to write programs that are both robust and easy to maintain as we cover the foundational knowledge required to make you a confident, productive, and skilled functional Scala developer.</description>
