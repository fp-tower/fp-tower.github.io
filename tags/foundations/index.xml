      <description>In February 2019, I started my biggest side project: a training course on Functional Programing in Scala. Iâ€™ve spent an estimated 2,000 hours on this venture and it is still not finished!
I have learned a lot from this project, but I have also made many mistakes along the way. So, I have decided to write a series of blog posts as a way of sharing my experience, and so that others can learn from my journey.</description>

      <description>After nearly two years of hard work, I am excited to announce Foundations of Functional Programming in Scala, is now available on Early Access!
Foundation is a self-paced online course that focuses on the practical side of functional programming. You will learn to write programs that are both robust and easy to maintain as we cover the foundational knowledge required to make you a confident, productive, and skilled functional Scala developer.</description>
