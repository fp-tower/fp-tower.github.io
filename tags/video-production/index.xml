      <description>In February 2019, I started my biggest side project: a training course on Functional Programing in Scala. Iâ€™ve spent an estimated 2,000 hours on this venture and it is still not finished!
I have learned a lot from this project, but I have also made many mistakes along the way. So, I have decided to write a series of blog posts as a way of sharing my experience, and so that others can learn from my journey.</description>
